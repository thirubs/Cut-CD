# Cut-CD
Cut-off Coordinate Descent (Cut-CD) Algorithm for Nonnegative Coupled Matrix Tensor Factorization

# Demo.m
Demo file will generate synthetic tensor and matrix datasets and factorizes the tensor using Cut-CD and Cut-CD-SC algorithms.


Note: You have to download the Tensor Toolbox for MATLAB for the Cut-CD algorithm to run.
